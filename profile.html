	<p id="infobody">As a Customer Support Associate, my role revolves around providing comprehensive assistance to clients utilizing our platform. Primarily, I aid clients in onboarding processes, guiding them through menu creation, and configuring the appearance of their kiosks. I am responsible for addressing any menu adjustments or modifications required by clients. 
	<br> <br>
	Additionally, I oversee various integrations with our portal, particularly focusing on ParBrink integration. Serving as the subject matter expert for ParBrink, I collaborate with Customer Success Managers (CSMs) to delve into integration details, ensuring smooth processes and enhancing client experiences. Communication with clients occurs through email, phone calls, and scheduling Google Meet sessions, while internal coordination with CSMs takes place via our internal chat platform, Slack. 
	<br> <br>
	Overall, my role is pivotal in facilitating seamless interactions between clients and our platform, ensuring optimal functionality and client satisfaction.</p>
